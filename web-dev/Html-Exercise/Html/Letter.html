        <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university appliaction</h2>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent appliaction to join us at tyhe univeristy of Awesome's science faculty to study as
            a part of your <u>Phd</u> next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the follwoing section.</p>
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your stusy with us at any time, however it would suit us better if

            <li>First Semester: 9 January 2022</li>
            <li>Second Semester: 15 May 2022</li>

        <p>please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="google.com">important universities dates</a> on our website.</p>
        <h3>Subjects of Study</h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we ahve a pretty open-minded research facilty - as long as the subject fall
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seems like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
            just the kind of person we'd like to have on oue team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
            intrigued by as the follows in order of priority: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benifitsof Resveratrol
                (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
            </li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempreasure exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F),
                when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x
                10<sup>4</sup>.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <abbr title="">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="">CSS</abbr> construct for representing musical scores.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thank.
        </p>
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p> Yes, you are right! AS part of my poast-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dance. To answer
            your question, my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influencing dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would
                dance arroyund in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be ""friutful".</dd>
                <dd>&nbsp;</dd>

            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fore as a means of getting warn, they used to practice this dance, which
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor , and suffling ther bodies arround in
                imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he throught this
                dance inspired modern style such as tweaking.</dd>
                <dd>&nbsp;</dd>

            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting exapmle of historic misinformation , Englisg explorers in the 1960s believed
                to have discoverd a new dance style charachterised by "robotic", stitled movements, being practice by
                ingabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving
                like this because they were really cold.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Your sincerely,</p>
